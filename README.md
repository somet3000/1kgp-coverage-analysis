Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and fine-mapping analysis of a cohort from the 1000 Genomes Project using both lower coverage and higher coverage (30x) data.

The raw VCF data can be obtained from the 1000 Genomes Project: https://www.internationalgenome.org/data

The gene expression data can be obtained from the BioStudies website for the RNA-sequencing 1KGP paper: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-GEUV-1/sdrf?full=true
